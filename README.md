## Project Overview
This project analyzes a sales dataset  customers in Europe, North America, and the Pacific to uncover insights into bike purchasing behavior. Using Excel (Pivot Tables, Charts, and Dashboards), the project answers key business questions and visualizes customer demographics, regional sales, and income patterns that influence bike purchases.

## Business Questions (KPIs)
•	What percentage of customers purchased a bike?
•	Which regions had the highest bike sales?
•	Do gender,children and age groups affect purchase decisions?
•	How does income differ between buyers and non-buyers?
•	Does commute distance influence the likelihood of buying a bike?
•	Which customer profiles (age, education, occupation) are more likely to purchase?

## Process
1.	Data Cleaning – handled missing values, standardized categorical fields, and created derived columns such as Age Ranges.
2.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – used Pivot Tables to analyze purchase behavior across demographics and regions.
3.	Visualization & Dashboards – built interactive Excel dashboards with KPIs, bar charts, pie charts, and a regional map.
4.	Insights & Reporting – summarized findings in a clear, business-friendly format.

## Key Insights
•	48.1% of customers purchased a bike.
•	Middle-aged customers (30–50 yrs) are the most likely to buy (~55% purchase rate).
•	Pacific region had the highest purchase rate (59%).
•	Higher-income customers are more likely to purchase (avg. income ~57,963 vs 54,875 for non-buyers).
•	Customers with shorter commutes (0–5 miles) are most likely to buy.
•	Bike purchases are nearly evenly split between men and women.
